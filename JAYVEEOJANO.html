      <h3 align="center">COOKING TIPS</h3> 
      <h6><h6> 1. Pan-fry the potatoes and carrots until lightly browned to keep them from falling apart when added to the stew. I also like to briefly saute the bell peppers as it draws out their natural sweetness. </h6> </br>
      <h6> 2. This recipe calls for bone-in chicken parts for a more robust flavor, but boneless, skinless breast or thigh meat works, too. </h6> </br>
      <h6> 3. For a smooth and creamy sauce, do not bring it to a rapid boil and cook at a gentle simmer lest the coconut milk curdles and separate.</h6></br>
      <h6> 4. Once the curry powder is added, give the sauce a few minutes to slow cook to allow the spices to release their flavors.
        Prefer a thicker consistency? Simmer uncovered so the excess liquid evaporates quickly and the sauce reduces without overcooking the meat and vegetables.</h6></br>

        <h3 align="center">HOW TO SERVE CHCICKEN CURRY</h3>
        <h6> The best way to serve this creamy chicken dish is with a piled high plate of steamed rice. While you can serve this with a gloriously aromatic garilc fried rice, you may want to let the neutral taste fo steamed rice to not overwhelm the taste of the sauce. You'll notice better how the sauce simply  makes this chicken meal come together deliciously.   </h6></br>
        <h6> However, if you're not feeling like have a rice meal, you can simply eat it on its own since the potatoes and carrots add heft and make it filling. You can also shred the chicken from the bone or use boneless chicken chunks and serve it with bread or even pita bread or naan. </h6></br>

      <h3 align="center"> STORAGE AND REHEATING INSTRUCTIONS</h3> 
      <h6>1. Curry is perfect for meal planning and makes great leftovers. Store in airtight containers or resealable bags and keep in the fridge for up to 3 days or in the freezer for up to 2 months.</h6></br>
      <h6>2. To reheat, place in a saucepan with a splash of water and heat over low heat. </h6></br
